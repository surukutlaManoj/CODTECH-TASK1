**Objective:**

The primary objective of this Python code is to create a basic calculator that can perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.       

**Key Activities:**

**Input**: The code prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.            
**Calculation**: The calculate function is called, passing the entered numbers and operator as arguments.          
**Error** **Handling**: The code uses a try-except block to handle potential errors, such as entering an invalid operator.        
**Output**: The calculated result is printed to the console.                   

**Technologies Used:**

**Python**: The code is written in Python, a popular high-level programming language.          
**Input/Output**: The input function is used to get user input, and the print function is used to display output.         
**Error Handling**: The try-except block is used to handle exceptions that may occur during the calculation process.                     

**Key Insights:**

**Function Definition and Usage:** The calculate function is defined to encapsulate the logic for performing the arithmetic operations. It takes the numbers and operator as input and returns the result.         
**Error Handling:** The try-except block is a crucial part of the code, as it prevents the program from crashing if the user enters an invalid operator.            
**Clarity and Readability:** The code is well-structured and easy to understand, with clear variable names and comments.              
**Flexibility:** The code can be easily extended to include additional operations or features.
